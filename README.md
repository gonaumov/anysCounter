# Counter of any usage in typescript code base

I had need to count usages of any in a TypeScript code base and 
I did that bash script. I am sharing it now in case someone 
has similar problem in te future. 

## How to use it? 

You will need Linux/Mac or Gitbash. Just 
place the file in the project root and execute
```
./counter.sh
```
It will create report.txt file for you.
